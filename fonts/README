                         Rockbox Font Collection

Fonts put here need to follow a few rules:

1. All fonts must be in standard unicode encoding (ISO10646-1). ISO8859-1
   would also work, but should be avoided for consistency, and converted to
   unicode (it's a trivial change of declaration, the actual code positions
   stay the same).
   Other encodings will break text output in rockbox for any non-ASCII text
   and are hence not allowed.
   
2. All fonts need to adhere to the following naming convention for easy
   browsing in rockbox:

      NN-Family-Variant.bdf

   NN is the height _in pixels_ when converted to .fnt with convbdf, zero
   padded for proper sorting in the file browser.

   "Family" is the font family (might consist of more than one part, e.g.
   "Adobe-Helvetica")
   
   "Variant" covers the weight and variant (might also consist of more than
   one part e.g. "Cond-BoldItalic"). This part should be left out if it is
   Regular/Normal/Medium. Do not abbreviate variant names unless they're
   overly long (keep in mind that the rockbox target displays vary a lot in
   size).

3. Fonts must have a suitable license for redistribution.

4. Fonts should be carefully selected, judging quality over quantity. A font
   that only covers ASCII isn't worth much. Rockbox supports a lot of
   languages.
