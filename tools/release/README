 This directory the scripts used to create release artifacts.  All
 generated data is stored in an output directory (called "output").

 All of these scripts take two arguments; the git tag and the version string.

 NOTE that these scripts assume that you have the necessary compilers already
 present in your PATH.

 The scripts:

   bins.pl          Builds all the binary rockbox zip files
   manuals.pl       Builds all manuals (pdf and html-zip)
   sources.sh       Builds the source tarball
   voices.pl        Builds all "complete enough" voice files

  Only "stable" targets, their manuals, and a selection of voice files are built;
  these are designated in tools/builds.pm

 Example:

   tools/release/sources.sh v3.15-final 3.15

 Other notes:

   * Update www/tools/dailybuild-voices.pl file to add the release target
     voice list!
   * Update release target in tools/builds.pm
